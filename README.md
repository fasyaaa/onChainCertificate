# About Project :
On Chain Certificate is for upload and check about certificate, utilizing a decentralized architecture powered by Solidity Smart Contracts and React.js. The platform features role-based access where only authorized admins can upload metadata to IPFS and mint NFTs, while a public verification interface allows anyone to query contract data to verify ownership and validity based on Student ID (NIM).

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
